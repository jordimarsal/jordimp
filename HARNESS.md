## Next

1. Edit `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/conventions.md` for this project.
2. Add features to `harness/feature_list.json`.
3. Project-specific additions to AGENTS.md (mandatory steps, map rows) go
   inside the `harness:project` block at the end of the file — preserved
   verbatim on --update.
3. Start the leader: `opencode`
4. Update later: re-run install.sh with `--update` (keeps specs, progress and settings).
