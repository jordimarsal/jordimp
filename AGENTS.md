# AGENTS.md — Navigation map for AI agents

> This file is the **entry point** for any agent working in this repository.
> It is NOT a rule bible — it is a **map**. Read only what you need, when you need it (progressive disclosure).

---

## 1. Before you start (mandatory)

1. Run `harness/init.sh` and verify it finishes without errors. If it fails, **stop** and fix the environment before touching code.
2. Read `harness/progress/current.md` to understand where the last session left off.
3. Read `harness/feature_list.json`. ALL features follow **Spec Driven Development** — see §4 of this file.
4. Read `docs/specs.md` before touching any spec or feature.

## 2. Repository map

## 3. Hard rules (non-negotiable)

- **One feature at a time.** Do not mix changes from multiple tasks in the same session.
- **Do not mark a task `done` without green tests.** Run `harness/init.sh` and ensure the test block passes 100%.
- **Do not skip the spec phase.** Every feature must go through `spec-author` and obtain human approval before touching code.
- **Do not skip the human approval gate.** The leader stops the flow at `spec_ready` and waits.
- **Document what you do** in `harness/progress/current.md` while working, not at the end.
- **Leave the repository clean** before closing the session (see §5).
- **If you don't know something, look in `docs/`** before inventing it.

## 4. Workflow (SDD — mandatory for all features)

```
pending → [spec-author] → spec_ready → ⏈ HUMAN → in_progress → [implementer → reviewer] → done
```

1. The leader detects the first `pending` feature.
2. The leader dispatches `spec-author`, who creates `harness/specs/<name>/{requirements,design,tasks}.md` and marks status as `spec_ready`.
3. **Pause.** The human reads the spec at `harness/specs/<name>/` and approves (or requests changes).
4. Once approved, the leader changes status to `in_progress` and dispatches `implementer`.
5. The implementer executes `tasks.md` one by one, marking them `[x]`.
6. The reviewer verifies traceability `R<n>` ↔ test and task completion; approves or rejects.
7. If approved, the implementer marks `done` and moves the summary to `harness/progress/history.md`.

### Parallelism

When `"parallel": true` in `harness/feature_list.json` project config:
- Independent tasks (no `depends_on`) can be dispatched to separate implementer subagents simultaneously.
- Only 1 feature may be `in_progress` at a time.

When `"parallel": false` (default): sequential execution, one task at a time.

## 5. Session lifecycle (closure)

Before finishing:

1. Run `harness/init.sh` — all green.
2. If the task is done: mark `status: "done"` in `harness/feature_list.json`.
3. Move the summary from `harness/progress/current.md` to the end of `harness/progress/history.md`.
4. Clear `harness/progress/current.md` leaving only the template.
5. Do not leave temporary files, debug prints, or context-free TODOs.

## 6. If you get stuck

- Re-read the relevant section of `docs/`.
- If a tool doesn't behave as expected, **do not invent a workaround**: document the block in `harness/progress/current.md` and stop the session.
